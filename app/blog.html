                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">The Quick & Easy Way to Success</a>
</dt>
                <dd>Lesson 1.  Be wary whenever you hear someone say you can succeed without difficulties.  There is no quick and easy way to success. <br>

<br>There is no quick and easy way to have a great relationship; it takes dedication, time, effort.<br>

<br>There is no quick and easy way to become financially successful; it takes a great deal of discipline, constant study, and hard work.<br>

<br>Though there is no shortcut to success, there is, however, a relatively simple route.  Personal growth.  If you are committed to investing time, energy, and even money into your personal growth, you will find success.<br>

<br>Most people want to have rich lives: full, healthy relationships, lots of money, fulfillment, achievement, and significance.  But most people don’t realize that in order for all these things to fit into your cup you have to first enlarge your cup.<br>

<br>If you try to pour a pitcher full of water into a shot-glass, you’ll see the trouble that many people have.<br>

<br>Who can successfully run a business who has not learned thousands of different things?  Who can have a healthy relationship who has not studied and practiced the art of unconditional love (teachings of Jesus)?  Who can become wealthy who has not strived, learned about investing, and mastered himself in restraint, not spending everything he makes?<br>

<br>Most people want to have more, but they don’t want to do the work to be more. Success is not about what you have but is more about who you are.  When you’re the kind of person who significantly helps others, you’ll find significance and fulfillment.  When you focus on working diligently, you’ll find achievement.  When you develop the kind of character that puts other people first, other people will naturally be attracted to you.<br>

<br>What about money?  Does that have to do with who you are?  The achievements of the wealthy man are often marginalized.  People see someone rich and they think, well, he was in the right place at the right time (luck).  But the truth is, he prepared himself so that when the right time and place came along, he was the right person to take advantage of the opportunity.<br>

<br>Action steps:  outline a self-development plan.  Take time for your own growth.<br>  <br>Some ideas:
<br>
•   Join Toastmasters (learn the art of communication, leadership, and public speaking)<br>
•   Enroll in a seminar to learn a specific skill<br>
•   Go to the library.  Find the personal development section and start reading.  THINK.  Process what you’ve learned and write down your thoughts.<br>
•   Go to church and listen to sermons or read the book of Proverbs in the bible.<br>
•   Plan and develop your own self-discipline (exercise, eating, time to achieve dreams).<br>
•   Volunteer.  Look for opportunities to serve others<br>
•   Find a mentor (someone who can give you wisdom and guide you)<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">The Subconscious Mind</a></dt>
                <dd>One of the most intriguing and consequential things on earth is the subconscious mind.  It handles an incredible number of different activities, coordinating them all at the same time, like a symphony conductor with an enormous activity.  It regulates body temperature, heartbeat, blood flow, oxygen/co2 exchange, assimilation, digestion, disease prevention, healing, muscle growth, fingernail and hair growth, cell replacement, and a thousand other activities without us even having to think about them with our conscious mind.<br>

<br>Did you realize that it never sleeps?  It never stops.  Even if you were to be hit on the head and rendered unconscious, the subconscious mind would continue to do its job.  Until death it will never cease to relentlessly carry out its duties.<br>

<br>The interesting thing about the activities mentioned above is that we never even had to learn them!  Our subconscious mind was already preprogrammed to take care of those things when we were born!  This is just the beginning of what the subconscious does.<br>

<br>There is another part to the subconscious mind that is made up of input from our lives: our experiences, things people said to us, things we told ourselves.  It is, in short, our beliefs.<br>

<br>Once set into motion, our subconscious mind never deviates from its goal.  But here’s something you need to know.<br>

<br>According to Maxwell Maltz,<br>

"A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment".<br>

 <br>In other words, your self-image and your philosophy come into play here.  If you tell yourself repeatedly that you are a clumsy person or that you’re not good with money, your subconscious mind will carry out these thoughts to fruition.<br>  <br>If you believe you’re not good enough to succeed, this message will imprint itself on your subconscious mind and it will faithfully follow instructions until it carries out the imagined result.<br>

<br>Our beliefs then become the filters for our subconscious mind- our subconscious mind will block out any realities that are not in sync with our beliefs.  This is why the guy who believes money is evil will never have any.  He will subconsciously sabotage himself every time he does get money to make sure he does not become evil.<br>

<br>Here’s another example of the misuse of the subconscious mind. A guy is short on rent and nearing the end of the month.  He begins to imagine what he’ll say to his landlord on the 1st of the month when he does not have the money.  He begins to play through this scenario in his mind and begins to prepare his rehearsed speech to explain his shortfall.<br>

<br>This is absolutely wrong and counterproductive.  He’s imprinting on his mind that he will be short on the rent.  He’s solidifying this notion in his subconscious mind.  What should he be imagining?  He should be envisioning himself giving his landlord the full amount of rent!  This is like the golfer who tells himself, “Don’t hit it in the pond!  Don’t hit it in the pond!”  What is he imprinting on his mind?  The pond!  He should be imagining himself hitting the ball on the green where he wants it to go.  The subconscious mind apparently cannot distinguish between negative and positive.  It works in images: you can’t visualize an image and then put an anti-sign over the top of it: you are still visualizing the unwanted image!<br>

<br>Worry and fear allowed to run rampant in the mind can cause an incredible amount of destruction and damage.<br>

<br>The subconscious mind is a potent force, but it has a most unusual shortcoming:  it has no filter to tell the difference between an imagined experience and a real one.<br>

<br>This seems nonsensical until you give it some thought:  have you ever woken from a nightmare and experienced the physical sensation brought on by the dream experience such as a racing pulse, sweating, shallow breathing, adrenaline rush?  Our subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference between reality and imagination.  Even in our waking lives, worry causes us to experience all sorts of symptoms, but most things we worry about never come to pass!<br>

<br>Experiments have been done with basketball players, comparing improvement from those who actually practiced to those who only practiced in their imaginations and the results have been nearly identical!<br>

<br>This makes it crucial for us to monitor what goes into our subconscious mind.  If we allow ourselves to be focused on a lack of abundance, this will be realized in our lives.  If we watch too much nightly news and convince ourselves that the world is a terrible place full of selfish and hurtful people, this will be the reality we experience.<br>

<br>If we come to believe that God is a judge to be dreaded rather than a loving, caring father figure who protects us and wants the best for us, we will experience the consequences of that in our lives.  We will fear judgment and distance ourselves from our creator rather than looking to God for succor, comfort, and guidance.<br>

<br>Begin now to carefully, meticulously envision what you do want out of life.  Take time when you wake in the morning, or before you go to sleep at night, when you are driving in your car, or whenever you can spare a moment to imagine your life as you would have it.  Imagine it so thoroughly that it will be imprinted indelibly on your subconscious mind.  As faithful as anything in the universe, it will have no choice but to carry out your bidding.<br>

<br>Action steps:  <br>Prune negative thinking out of your life.  Begin to build a positive vision of your future.  Build a vision board.  Write down your goals.  Vividly imagine what it would be like to have already completed these goals.<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Alien Abduction Insurance?</a></dt>
                <dd>We humans have a fundamental need for certainty.  We need to know that tomorrow we’ll be able to eat.  We want to be able to understand things, to ensure our safety, to predict the future and control the outcome of our lives.<br>

<br>In our modern day world, we seemed to have escalated our need for certainty.  Look at us!  We try to insure against every possible mishap!  There are insurance policies for homes, cars, life, health, and we’ve moved on to such things as terrorism insurance, travel insurance, pet insurance, crime insurance, and even such bizarre and comic policies as alien abduction insurance!<br>

<br>Do we think we can possibly avoid all pain by insuring ourselves against every possible catastrophe?<br>

<br>It’s ironic that in the search for absolute safety, consumers are working themselves to death to pay the premiums on their insurance bills.  Perhaps we need to add a category- insurance against too many insurance premiums.  I wonder what that would cost?<br>

<br>Why is insurance such a big business?  It is fear that drives many people to make the choices they do.  They constantly think about avoiding loss, instead of experiencing life. People, it seems are more concerned with what they might lose than with what they might accomplish.<br>

<br>You’ve all heard the saying, no risk, no reward, right?  Take a look at any successful person and you’ll find someone who stuck their neck out in a way that most don’t dare to do.  I challenge you to think of one successful person who hasn’t risked themselves significantly.<br>

<br>Now security may not sound like such a bad thing to you.  We all desire some reassurance that tomorrow won’t find us starving and on the streets.  But is security really good?  Let me illustrate with an example of what is probably the ultimate level of security: prison.  In jail, you are guaranteed a place to sleep, three square meals a day, and your time is your own.  But of freedom, you have none.  Prison offers the best security of any lifestyle you could possibly have.<br>

<br>Imagine if you will a mature bald eagle, launching from it’s perch atop a tall Frasier pine.  It is soaring over the valley below, seeking prey.<br>

<br>Our society would see this eagle and say: that’s dangerous.  It’s too high.  What if it falls?  And what if it can’t find enough food?  It’s not safe.<br>

<br>Now, imagine that same eagle in a wire cage at the zoo.<br>

<br>Our society would see this and say: That eagle is safe.  It can’t fly, but it can’t fall.  It’s guaranteed three meals a day and all the veterinary care it needs. That eagle has it made!<br>

<br>But does that eagle have it made?  When it can no longer do what it was designed by God to do, does it indeed have it made?<br>

<br>"If we don’t change, we don’t grow.
If we don’t grow, we are not really living.
Growth demands a temporary surrender of security."<br>
-Gail Sheehy<br>

<br>In our modern society, we’ve become stagnant.  We plan our lives around risk-free activities, and then at night, in the safety of our own homes, we attempt to fulfill our need for adventure by living vicariously through characters on television.   We like to read about and watch on the television characters that undergo struggles and conquer adversity, but we’d rather not experience any difficulties ourselves.  We’ve become so comfortable with our modern luxuries that we’ve forgotten how to strive.  Tony Campolo puts it this way: We tiptoe through life just so we can arrive safely at death!<br>

<br>Two hundred years ago, people set sail across the ocean to America because it offered the opportunity of freedom.  It offered no guarantees and no security, but people came because they knew freedom was more important than security.<br> 

<br>Since our forefathers founded this country, we’ve undergone a substantial shift.  We’ve gone from wanting to be free to wanting to be safe and secure.  This is evidenced in social security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and countless other government programs designed to provide a “safety net.” <br>

<br>But have you noticed yet what the relationship is between freedom and security?  They are polar opposites.  You can’t have freedom without giving up some measure of security.  And vice versa.  Are we running toward our dreams and goals or in our quest for safety have we resigned ourselves to running on a hamster wheel to pay for all that “safety?”  Are we still able to do what we were designed by God to do?<br>

<br>"An individual dies... when, instead of taking risks and hurling himself toward being, he cowers within, and takes refuge there."<br>  –E. M. Cioran<br>

<br>"The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise."<br>  –Tacitus<br>

<br>"Comfort is the enemy of achievement."<br>  –Farrah Gray<br>

<br>"...those who don’t have the courage to take risks and those who do experience the same amount of fear in life.  The only difference is that those who don’t take chances worry about trivial things.  If you’re going to have to overcome your fear and doubts anyway, you might as well make it count."<br>  – John Maxwell<br>

<br>Action Step: This week, risk yourself in a way you’ve never done before (I’m not advocating stupidly foolish risks; rather a life based on truly living, not on fear).<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Freedom Through Self-Mastery</a></dt>
                <dd>I’d like to talk about a subject that is important to me and that subject is freedom.  As you know, I’d like to teach people how to become financially free, but I’d also like to help them live free lives in general.  We live in America, a beacon of freedom the world over, but how free are we?  I think many Americans have some misconceptions about what freedom is, and I’d like to address that today. I see them struggling to get free from a number of different issues:<br>


<br>Consumer Debt<br>
Materials Things<br>
Alcohol<br>
Cigarettes<br>
Drugs<br>
Pornography/sexual addictions<br>
Food<br>
T.V.<br>
Caffeine<br>
<br>Security (the idea that there should be no risk in life and that someone else should always be there to take care of us- be it our boss, the government, or the insurance companies).<br>

<br>The items on this list vary, and some of the items on this list are not intrinsically bad.  I think we can agree that it’s okay to have a glass of wine, for example, but the problem comes when we lose control of ourselves.  If I see a donut on the table, and as I’m walking by I tell myself, “I am not going to eat that donut,” and then a minute later notice it’s gone and I have sugary donut residue on my fingers, then I have a problem.  I’m not, in truth, free.  I’m actually a slave to my own impulse.  I’m not a slave to the donut- it’s just a piece of food sitting on the table.  But I am a slave to my own impulse.  I think this is where we face the greatest risk as a nation today.<br>

<br>Socrates said:<br>

"The truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery, while those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them."<br>

<br>Have you noticed that our government is getting bigger?  Have you stopped to wonder why?<br>

<br>As someone who has struggled to get free from a lot of the above-mentioned issues, I can tell you something I’ve learned along the way.<br>

<br>Habits are not changed by will-power alone, but by new ideas and new perspectives.<br>

<br>Let me give you an example:<br>

I started smoking at the age of 14 and quit shortly before I turned 20.  Why did I start smoking?  As an act of rebellion.  As an act of independence. I bought the advertisers imagery (you remember images of ruggedly independent cowboys smoking cigarettes).  Why did I quit?  It wasn’t health or finances that enticed me to quit.  What really galvanized me to quit was when I realized I was no longer a free man. I had become a slave to the tobacco companies.  Here I was sending them my money each week, making them wealthy, while killing myself slowly.  That’s not an act of independence!  That’s an act of self-destruction!<br>

<br>I’d like to ask you: how free are you?<br>

<br>Are you free from slavery to money?  Or does it dictate your actions nearly every waking hour?  Can you start your morning without the proper dosage of caffeine?  Are you free from the television?  Or are you addicted to the warped fiction of Hollywood and the gloom and doom of the nightly news?<br>

<br>Tony Robbins has a quote related to success I’d like to share with you: <br> 

“Success is doing what you want to do, when you want, where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want.”<br>

<br>Though I have a great respect for Tony and his teaching ability, I have to tell you that Tony is DEAD WRONG!  He couldn’t be farther from the truth.  <br>

<br>Success is not doing what you want, when you want.  That formula actually leads to to ruin and enslavement.  If you don’t know what I mean, I’ll illustrate:<br>

<br>Let’s take the realm of finance per se.  If you were to spend whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted, where would you end up?  You’d be bankrupt!  The same applies to every other area of your life.<br>

<br>Success is not doing what you want.<br> 

<br>Success is being able to do what’s right when the time comes.  Success is training yourself in self-discipline and self mastery.  That brings freedom.  So freedom is not something we inherit from our government or our country, or even our God.  Freedom is available to us, but we have to earn it.  If you want the freedom to live the ultimate life of wealth, health, peace, love, and happiness, there is only one way to achieve it.  Through self-mastery.<br>
</dd>
                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Success is What? Discipline?</a></dt>
                <dd>If I were to advertise that I was going to give a speech on the subject of discipline, how many people would show up?<br>  

<br>How many of you would say, “Yeah!  I’ve been wanting to learn more about how I can discipline myself!”<br>

<br>Discipline is not a popular subject in our culture today.<br>

<br>But let me ask you some questions:<br>

<br>Do you want to be healthy?  Live a long life?<br>

<br>Would you like to be wealthy?  Or at the very least comfortable, having enough money?<br>

<br>Would you like to have good relationships in your life?<br>

<br>Then you NEED discipline.<br>

<br>Let’s start with health.  We all know how to exercise.  We all know the difference between healthy food and junk food.  We simply lack the discipline to make the right choices when the time comes.<br>

<br>The foundation for any healthy diet is what?  Discipline.<br>  
<br>Let’s look at finances.<br>

<br>We all know HOW to become wealthy.  Budget, live on less than you make, save, and invest.  But we often lack the discipline to do the right thing.<br>

<br>If you watch what television is selling, it oftentimes isn’t a product.  What it is they’re selling is what we as consumers are demanding.  We want instant results with LITTE TO NO WORK!  But you and I both know that’s now how things work.<br>

<br>There’s a quote in the bible that says:<br>

<br>Hebrews 12:11<br>  "All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness."<br>

<br>This is one of my favorite verses.  Every time you decide not to eat the chocolate bar and reach for an apple, you might feel a sense of loss, but in reality you are training and gaining in strength.  Every time you decide to hold off on that purchase you didn’t need to make, you might feel a momentary pang of regret, but it will ultimately lead to a wealthier and more financially secure life!  Every time you reject sin, you might feel like you’re missing out on something fun, but you’re not.  In reality, when you reject sin, you’re embracing peace and joy, and love!  Wouldn’t you agree that love, joy, and peace are essential elements to a successful life?<br>

<br>How many of you would agree that love is the secret to having the best life possible?<br>

<br>I’m telling you that without discipline, you will not be able to love and be loved!  That’s how serious this is.<br>

<br>Matthew Kelly Teaches the following:<br>

"To love requires us to take ourselves in our hands and give ourselves away.  But we can’t give ourselves if we do not first possess ourselves.  Many people are making promises they can’t keep in relationships today.  They are promising to give themselves in ways they are not able to do because they do not possess themselves.  They have no self-mastery, no discipline, and therefore are not free.  In order to love, we have to be free.  You will be able to love and be loved to the extent that you wrench yourself away from your temper, your appetites, and your impulses.  This is why we see such a huge lack of good relationships in our culture.  For someone who is addicted to instant gratification, a lasting relationship is an impossible dream."<br>

<br>I think it’s noteworthy to notice the way God set this system up.  The only way to say “YES” to the best life has to offer is to be able to say “NO” to yourself.   In every area of your life, you need discipline.<br>

<br>If you want to see improvement in your life, try increasing your level of self-discipline.  There is an inextricable link between success and self-discipline. <br> 

<br>Action Step:  Begin improving your levels of self-discipline today even if in small ways.  Through diet, exercise, and relationship, begin to practice self-discipline.  Learn to say no to yourself.<br>

            <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">The Tallest Building?</a></dt>
<dd>How many of you have ever felt the tiniest bit jealous or resentful or angry at someone else’s success?<br>

<br>How many of you have ever had someone else feel that way about your success?<br>

<br>It is not uncommon in our society to resent people who are successful.<br>  

<br>If you want to be the tallest building in town, you can do it one of two ways- you can tear down everyone else’s buildings or you can continue building on your own, even after everyone else stops.<br>

<br>If you tear down everyone else’s buildings, however, how long do you think it’ll be before they come to tear down yours?<br>

<br>There’s something you need to know:<br>

<br>If you feel resentful, or envious of someone else’s success - even if you feel a little uncomfortable with someone else’s success, you’re in trouble.<br>

<br>Guess what?  When you feel that way, you’re guaranteeing you will never reach that level of success!  Why?  Because you’re training your mind that that level of success is bad!  If you are uncomfortable with the thought of someone else achieving that level of success, you will NEVER be comfortable achieving it yourself.  Even if you start to near that level of success, you’ll sabotage yourself because your brain is now programmed to STAY AWAY from that!<br>

<br>I tell my children all the time about the law of reciprocity.  What you wish for other people is what will happen for you.  If you wish ill on other people, bad things will happen to you!<br>

<br>So the first thing I want you to do is start saying prayers for people.  If you’re not spiritual, then send them positive energy, or good wishes, or however you’d like to phrase it.  But NEVER wish anyone harm!<br>

<br>Half of our society is currently resentful of the wealthy.  Our government has done an excellent job of inciting class warfare.  They spread this lie that the wealthy somehow hold down the poor.  That the poor are only poor because the wealthy keep too much of the money!<br>

<br>This is the craziest lie I’ve ever heard in my life, but people believe it.  In fact, some of you believe it.  Some people, no matter what I say will continue to believe that lie.<br>

<br>But it’s false.  And I’ll tell you why.<br>

<br>Our economy is not like a piece of pie where if I take out a slice, that means there is less available for you.  That’s not how it works.<br>

<br>Let me give you an example to illustrate:  If I hire a contractor to come and fix up my kitchen, and pay him $10K, then that $10K has gone out of my pocket and into his pocket, right?  No net gain, right?  Wrong. <br> 

<br>You’ve forgotten the matter of my house.  Because my house is now worth $10K MORE than it was before.  Or if not 10K, then certainly 5K more!<br>

<br>By working and creating, we expand the level of wealth in our community and our society.<br>

<br>This is just one example of millions.<br>

<br>If I become successful and wealthy, I don’t hold other people down!  I actually help other people.  What’s the first thing I do if I become wealthy?  I buy a bigger house.  Boon for the home-builder, right?  Then I have to hire maintenance people and landscapers to take care of my larger home, right?  Boon for them too!  I have a larger family and then I need to buy a bigger car.  Cool!  The car salesperson at the local lot gets to make a living!  And on and on and on! <br>

<br>The idea that the wealthy hold down the poor is laughable. <br>

<br>How many poor people do you know who provide jobs to other people?  Are jobs something we need right now in this economy?<br>

<br>But the rich are demonized!  What’s the first thing most people think when they see a BMW or a Mercedes?  Rich Snob!  Thinks he owns the road!  What’s the first thing most people think when they see a wealthy person’s mansion?  He must have stolen to get that!<br>

<br>If you do anything less than jump for joy at your fellow man’s success, you’re in trouble.  Why would you begrudge them the very thing you want for yourself?<br>

<br>Everywhere you go, begin to cheer other people on to success.  Better yet, help them achieve it.  According to the law of reciprocity, if you do that, you will in turn be helped yourself.<br>

<br>Here’s a Zig Ziglar quote:  "You can have everything you want, if you will help other people get what they want."<br>

<br>Action step:  Change the way you think about the wealthy.<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Admitting the Problem</a></dt>
<dd>
<br>One of the biggest obstacles I face as a teacher of success is that people are often reluctant to entertain new ideas.  Even when the philosophies and beliefs they hold are counterproductive, they hesitate to let them go.<br>

<br>I know how this can happen.  Fear of change is human nature.  But the simple fact is, people come to me, wanting to change their lives, yet they are afraid to change themselves. <br> 

<br>I explain to them that without changing themselves, they are unlikely to ever change their circumstances.<br>

<br>The fact is that in most circumstances, people are directly responsible for their current state of affairs.  The decisions they made yesterday affect where they are today.  But they often refuse to embrace this truth.<br>

<br>When they are in debt, they blame someone else; the economy, the boss, etc.  But who spent their money?<br>

<br>When they are unable to find work, they refuse to accept responsibility.  But who punched in 5 minutes late and left 5 minutes early every day?  Who was more interested in a paycheck than in actually contributing to the profits of the company?  Who neglected to make other contacts and build a contingency plan?<br> 

<br>When they are in relationship crisis, they blame the other person.  But having good relationships is not about finding the right person.  It’s about being the right person.<br>

<br>I’m not saying that bad things don’t happen to good people.  But people often refuse to point the finger at themselves.  And without an acknowledgment of the problem, a solution can’t be reached.<br>

<br>It takes courage to face your own shortcomings.  Only a brave person is willing to lay themselves open for inspection and criticism.<br>

<br>Sometimes when you lay yourself open for criticism, you get poor feedback.  Sometimes it hurts to be made aware that you are somehow falling short.  But if you are not willing to brave this pain and discomfort, you will never grow.  Avoiding this pain might bring a sense of comfort, but it won’t ever bring success.<br>

<br>If you want to live a truly singular and sublime life, you have to continue to improve yourself.  It’s as simple as that.  Not easy to do, but easy to understand.<br>

<br>I always know when students will be successful because they are willing to accept correction.  They are willing to weather the negative criticism to get the prize of the wisdom that accompanies it.  As a mentor and a teacher, I want to concentrate my efforts where they will do the most good.  And these students show the most promise.<br>

<br>Success, I’ve learned, requires changing the way you think.  More important than planning and striving is changing your mindset.  Our society teaches a philosophy that leads to failure if you follow it.  You must learn a different philosophy in order to succeed.  Learning this new philosophy is sometimes difficult.  Some of the ideas don’t seem to make logical sense when juxtaposed with the old philosophy.  But I can tell you with certainty there is a philosophy that does lead to success.  It is not a new philosophy.  I did not invent it.  It is not a secret.<br> 

<br>In order to adopt this philosophy, you have to realize that the philosophy you currently have is not serving you well.  You have to let it go!<br>

<br>Like building a house on a faulty foundation, so is building a life on an improper philosophy.  It will fail.  It saddens me to watch people try to rebuild again and again without ever correcting the problem of the foundation.  It seems insane to continue living in this fashion.  I realize it’s hard work to correct a foundation.  It requires lots of heavy lifting.  But if you don’t do it, your house will fall.<br>

<br>Here’s the good news.  Once you have the correct foundation in place, everything else will begin to fall into place.<br>

<br>Action step:  Be willing to be wrong.  Be open to new ideas, rebuke, and criticism.  It doesn’t feel good to be corrected, but it leads to a place that does feel good.<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Grab the Rope! (Quicksand)</a></dt>
<dd>I’m walking through the woods when I come upon a clearing.  In the middle of a clearing is a bog of quicksand and in the middle of the bog is a man, up to his neck, about to go under for good.  I am standing on solid ground, and I happen to have a coil of sturdy rope in my hands.  I cast out the rope and it falls within reach of the man.  I wait for him to reach out and grab it, but he doesn’t.  I call out, exhorting and imploring for him to grab the rope.  Slowly, his head disappears from view and he is lost.<br>

<br>Why wouldn’t he reach out for help?<br>

<br>Not literally, but figuratively, this situation pops up all the time in my life.  I find someone who is struggling with an issue I have mastered.  I offer to give help.  They do not accept the offer.  They continue with their struggle and their situation worsens.<br>

<br>Why wouldn’t they reach out for help?<br>

<br>For example, I have often offered to give financial counsel to someone who is struggling with debt.  I have offered to give it for free.  As someone who is financially free, I am qualified to help, but I rarely see people accept that help.<br>

<br>Whether through pride or embarrassment or simply a refusal to admit the need for help, people seldom will accept the help of others.  In the guise of independence, they will crash and burn before humbling themselves to seek aid.<br>

<br>Humility is a key ingredient for success.<br> 

<br>If you are struggling with your weight, are you humble enough to approach someone who has mastered physical fitness and ask for advice?<br>  

<br>If you are unhappy in your marriage, do you seek the counsel of a truly happy couple?<br>

<br>If you are dirt-poor, are you willing to apprentice yourself to someone who has mastered the intricacies of money?<br>

<br>There are two courses you can take in life.  You can either be content with misery, or find the courage to strive for improvement.  It takes humility to reach out to someone.  It takes risk to reach out for help.  But how safe is it where you are now: up to your neck in quicksand?<br>


<br>Action step:  If you’re struggling with a problem, get help.  There are people who are willing and interested to help you.  Find one, humble yourself, and approach them for assistance.  It’s not a sign of weakness to reach out for help.  It’s a sign of wisdom.<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Reticular Activating System?</a></dt>
<dd>The human mind is one of the most consequential and impressive forces in the world, but it is so often misunderstood and misused.  Guided and channeled, it can overcome virtually any obstacle.  Left undisciplined, it can create no end of neuroses, psychoses, and disorders. <br>

<br>Traditional success literature espouses the importance of “thinking positively” but no text I’ve ever read has explained exactly why this is so important.  So I want to tell you about the reticular activating system and how understanding is it essential for your success.  We have, as a part of our mental apparatus, something called the Reticular Activating System.  The Reticular Activating System (RAS), located in the brain stem, is thought to perform a number of different functions, the most intriguing of which is the function of selecting which of millions of sensory stimuli are delivered to the conscious mind.  In other worlds, it acts as a filter, deciding which details are “noticed” and which details are ignored.  In fact, the word reticular means net-like in form or structure.<br>

<br>You see, your senses take in millions and millions of detains every minute; right now, you are detecting odors in the air (hopefully pleasant ones), sensing the temperature with your skin, your eyes are taking in details all around you, the textures of material, the colors of surfaces.  But that’s too much information for the conscious mind to process.  It can only handle a few details at a given time. So our Reticular Activating System (RAS) edits out almost all of the information we take in. So the important question then is: what determines which pieces of information your RAS deems important?  How is your RAS trained?<br>

<br>What happens when you buy a new car?  Let’s assume for a moment it is a silver Toyota Camry.  What do you suddenly begin to notice as you are driving around town?  Other Toyota Camries, right?  Especially silver ones.  But why?  Because you took the time to look closer at that particular car; you researched it, and then immersed yourself in it, experienced it, and in taking those steps, you trained your RAS to label that information as significant.  So what is it that trains our RAS?   Our conscious mind does!  Does it serve any useful function for your to notice other people’s Toyota Camries?  Not really.  So we can take from this that our RAS can be programmed to notice stupid and meaningless details.  Conversely, left untrained, it can fail to notice crucially important details.<br>

<br>A woman I know who had a terribly abusive childhood.  She was abused physically and sexually.  And somehow she managed to emerge from that experience being a total sweetheart.  But what did she do when she got older and went looking for a man?  To what sort of man did she find herself attracted?  You guessed it.  The same domineering and abusive type as her father.  Why?  She never had any experience with the kind and gentle type.  Her RAS deemed the abusive, domineering type as significant (not good significant, but significant nonetheless).  So along the way, I’m quite certain she came across some very thoughtful and kind men, but here’s the point I’m trying to make.  She wouldn’t have noticed them!  They wouldn’t have showed up on her radar screen.  Like a chameleon disguised to blend into its background, that type of man would have been invisible to her.  Her eyes would have swept right past the good man and landed on the one her RAS decided was worthy of notice. <br> 

<br>Some success teachers talk about the law of attraction.  This is the idea that we attract certain events, people, and circumstances in our lives.  This might sound silly or mystical until you factor in the RAS.  What we lend significance to in our lives becomes our focus.  Our focus then trains our RAS to notice MORE of that same thing.  Can you see just how important it is to diligently free yourself from negative thoughts and turn them toward more positive ones? <br> 

<br>If we don’t control our thoughts and train our RAS to recognize the positive aspects of life, we become like the poorly-trained prospector who lets the gold sift right through his fingers without even noticing it.<br>

<br>Are we in a recession right now?  Do you think that because we’re in a recession, there is a lack of opportunity?  That’s what most people think.  But I would disagree.  I think there’s more opportunity than ever before!  And there’s less competition because so many people are afraid to try!  As a real estate investor, the recession has brought me a tremendous amount of opportunity.  I can buy houses now that make fantastic investments!  Most people think real estate is a bad investment because it recently declined in value.  The opposite is actually true.<br>

<br>Because I’ve studied real estate, immersed myself it in, and experienced it, I’ve trained my brain to look for amazing deals, and I find them.  My RAS is trained to notice opportunities in the same way yours notices Toyota Camries.<br>

<br>Most people don’t see opportunity though it is all around them.  They walk past piles of money on the sidewalk, but are totally blind to it.  They are focused on the problems in the world instead of the opportunity. <br>

<br>"Many an object is not seen, though it falls within the range of our visual ray, because it does not come within range of our intellectual ray."  –Henry David Thoreau<br>

<br>If you focus on the cracks in the pavement, you’re training your mind to find more cracks.  If you turn your gaze to the horizon and focus on the glorious sunrise, with all the possibility it brings, you are training your mind to look for more opportunity, more possibility, and recognize more beauty in life.<br>

<br>Understanding and taking control of your mind is the most important thing you’ll ever do in terms of achieving success.<br>

                <dt><a class="blogTitle" style="font-size:21px;" href="">Financial Freedom- the Right Psychology</a></dt>
<dd>How do you become financially free?  In my seminars, I talk a great deal about very specific actions you can take to become financially free.<br>

<br>In summation, the way to financial freedom is to spend the bulk of your time and energy buying or creating assets that produce residual income. <br>  

<br>But even more important than the mechanics is the psychology of financial freedom.<br>

<br>Most people don’t feel wealthy now.   They anticipate that wealth brings happiness and security.  So logically speaking, if they are not already wealthy (in terms of dollars) they don’t feel happiness and security.  They believe that only when they’ve achieved that wealth can they be happy and secure.<br>

<br>This is false!  It’s the same thing I went through when I began this journey.  I thought that only when I didn’t have to work anymore would I be happy and secure.<br>

<br>But not one day of my life went by when I didn’t have the opportunity to be happy and secure.<br>

<br>I’ll let you in on a secret.  Money doesn’t bring happiness.  And believe it or not, money doesn’t bring security either.<br>

<br>These are states of mind.<br>

<br>No one wants money because they like to have little green pieces of paper!  They want money for what they think it will do for them.<br>

<br>What happens with most people is that by the time they achieve the wealth they had hoped to attain, they no longer feel it’s enough.  They’ve increased their levels of spending and now have a different goal in mind.  <br>

<br>It’s the mentality that says, I’ll be happy when....<br>

<br>To put it bluntly, if this is your mentality, then you’re not happy.  If you can only be happy in the future, then you cannot be happy in the now.  Even though it’s good to plan for the future, you can’t live in the future.  You can only live in the now.  So when you try to live in the future, you miss life as it is!  This is a tragedy!<br>

<br>Can you be happy now?  Can you feel secure now? <br> 

<br>Let me see if I can lead you to a state of gratitude.  Can you think of all the things you enjoy in life that you didn’t have to make?  Think about all your blessings for a moment:<br>

<br>Did someone raise you and feed you and teach you how to get along in the world?  Do you drive a car that someone else made for you?  Do you have shelter?  Does that shelter have air conditioning?  Do you drive on roads that someone else paved for you?  Do you have access to the public library where you can read for your entire life and still never get through all the books?  Do you have access to good, healthy food?  Clean water?  Do you have adequate clothing?<br>  

<br>If you begin to make a list of all your blessings, you’ll find the list will never end.  You can literally start writing and not run out of things to write.<br>

<br>I’m absolutely astounded at how many people went out of their way to help me in my lifetime.  Thousands, tens of thousands have gone to great lengths to help me have a better life.  Lots of these people achieved success and instead of simply sitting on the beach, they took the time to write a book to teach their success to me.  How many authors have influenced my life for the better?  How about my parents, and family members, spiritual leaders, bosses and teachers who all took an interest in my development and growth?<br>

<br>I’m amazed and incredibly grateful for that.  It motivates me to give back to society.<br>

<br>I can live in a state of gratitude, or I can be upset about the handful of times when someone took advantage of me.  I can think about all the things I have or focus on what I don’t have!  I can focus on all the opportunity or I can dwell on the troubles in the world and my own personal problems.<br>

<br>One is a state of wealth and security.  One is a state of lack and fear.<br>

<br>Your underlying beliefs create your thoughts and emotions.  If you have the belief that there is not enough money to go around and that only when you’ve scrounged and hoarded enough money to keep yourself safe will you be okay, you’ll lead a miserable existence!  <br>

<br>The word “affluent” comes from the Latin word Fluere which means to flow.<br>

<br>The word “currency” comes from the Latin word Currere, which means to run (or to flow as in electricity).<br>

<br>It’s not so much about collecting and stockpiling it, rather it’s about keeping it moving and sharing and doing great things.<br>

<br>When you begin to see just how wealthy you already are, you attract that into your life. By being grateful and happy, you attract an entirely different kind of person into your life than you do when you’re griping, and always focused on the negative.<br>

<br>No matter how much money you have, you can never be financially free if you don’t assume an inner state of wealth.<br>

<br>Action step:  Count your blessings.  Even though you strive to achieve goals, do your best to be happy now.<br>
