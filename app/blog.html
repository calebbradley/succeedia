                <dt><a style="font-size:21px;" href="">The Quick & Easy Way to Success</a></dt>
                <dd>Lesson 1.  Be wary whenever you hear someone say you can succeed without difficulties.  There is no quick and easy way to success. <br>

<br>There is no quick and easy way to have a great relationship; it takes dedication, time, effort.<br>

<br>There is no quick and easy way to become financially successful; it takes a great deal of discipline, constant study, and hard work.<br>

<br>Though there is no shortcut to success, there is, however, a relatively simple route.  Personal growth.  If you are committed to investing time, energy, and even money into your personal growth, you will find success.<br>

<br>Most people want to have rich lives: full, healthy relationships, lots of money, fulfillment, achievement, and significance.  But most people don’t realize that in order for all these things to fit into your cup you have to first enlarge your cup.<br>

<br>If you try to pour a pitcher full of water into a shot-glass, you’ll see the trouble that many people have.<br>

<br>Who can successfully run a business who has not learned thousands of different things?  Who can have a healthy relationship who has not studied and practiced the art of unconditional love (teachings of Jesus)?  Who can become wealthy who has not strived, learned about investing, and mastered himself in restraint, not spending everything he makes?<br>

<br>Most people want to have more, but they don’t want to do the work to be more. Success is not about what you have but is more about who you are.  When you’re the kind of person who significantly helps others, you’ll find significance and fulfillment.  When you focus on working diligently, you’ll find achievement.  When you develop the kind of character that puts other people first, other people will naturally be attracted to you.<br>

<br>What about money?  Does that have to do with who you are?  The achievements of the wealthy man are often marginalized.  People see someone rich and they think, well, he was in the right place at the right time (luck).  But the truth is, he prepared himself so that when the right time and place came along, he was the right person to take advantage of the opportunity.<br>

<br>Action steps:  outline a self-development plan.  Take time for your own growth.<br>  <br>Some ideas:
<br>
•   Join Toastmasters (learn the art of communication, leadership, and public speaking)<br>
•   Enroll in a seminar to learn a specific skill<br>
•   Go to the library.  Find the personal development section and start reading.  THINK.  Process what you’ve learned and write down your thoughts.<br>
•   Go to church and listen to sermons or read the book of Proverbs in the bible.<br>
•   Plan and develop your own self-discipline (exercise, eating, time to achieve dreams).<br>
•   Volunteer.  Look for opportunities to serve others<br>
•   Find a mentor (someone who can give you wisdom and guide you)<br>

                <dt><a style="font-size:21px;" href="">The Subconscious Mind</a></dt>
                <dd>One of the most intriguing and consequential things on earth is the subconscious mind.  It handles an incredible number of different activities, coordinating them all at the same time, like a symphony conductor with an enormous activity.  It regulates body temperature, heartbeat, blood flow, oxygen/co2 exchange, assimilation, digestion, disease prevention, healing, muscle growth, fingernail and hair growth, cell replacement, and a thousand other activities without us even having to think about them with our conscious mind.<br>

<br>Did you realize that it never sleeps?  It never stops.  Even if you were to be hit on the head and rendered unconscious, the subconscious mind would continue to do its job.  Until death it will never cease to relentlessly carry out its duties.<br>

<br>The interesting thing about the activities mentioned above is that we never even had to learn them!  Our subconscious mind was already preprogrammed to take care of those things when we were born!  This is just the beginning of what the subconscious does.<br>

<br>There is another part to the subconscious mind that is made up of input from our lives: our experiences, things people said to us, things we told ourselves.  It is, in short, our beliefs.<br>

<br>Once set into motion, our subconscious mind never deviates from its goal.  But here’s something you need to know.<br>

<br>According to Maxwell Maltz,<br>

"A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment".<br>

 <br>In other words, your self-image and your philosophy come into play here.  If you tell yourself repeatedly that you are a clumsy person or that you’re not good with money, your subconscious mind will carry out these thoughts to fruition.<br>  <br>If you believe you’re not good enough to succeed, this message will imprint itself on your subconscious mind and it will faithfully follow instructions until it carries out the imagined result.<br>

<br>Our beliefs then become the filters for our subconscious mind- our subconscious mind will block out any realities that are not in sync with our beliefs.  This is why the guy who believes money is evil will never have any.  He will subconsciously sabotage himself every time he does get money to make sure he does not become evil.<br>

<br>Here’s another example of the misuse of the subconscious mind. A guy is short on rent and nearing the end of the month.  He begins to imagine what he’ll say to his landlord on the 1st of the month when he does not have the money.  He begins to play through this scenario in his mind and begins to prepare his rehearsed speech to explain his shortfall.<br>

<br>This is absolutely wrong and counterproductive.  He’s imprinting on his mind that he will be short on the rent.  He’s solidifying this notion in his subconscious mind.  What should he be imagining?  He should be envisioning himself giving his landlord the full amount of rent!  This is like the golfer who tells himself, “Don’t hit it in the pond!  Don’t hit it in the pond!”  What is he imprinting on his mind?  The pond!  He should be imagining himself hitting the ball on the green where he wants it to go.  The subconscious mind apparently cannot distinguish between negative and positive.  It works in images: you can’t visualize an image and then put an anti-sign over the top of it: you are still visualizing the unwanted image!<br>

<br>Worry and fear allowed to run rampant in the mind can cause an incredible amount of destruction and damage.<br>

<br>The subconscious mind is a potent force, but it has a most unusual shortcoming:  it has no filter to tell the difference between an imagined experience and a real one.<br>

<br>This seems nonsensical until you give it some thought:  have you ever woken from a nightmare and experienced the physical sensation brought on by the dream experience such as a racing pulse, sweating, shallow breathing, adrenaline rush?  Our subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference between reality and imagination.  Even in our waking lives, worry causes us to experience all sorts of symptoms, but most things we worry about never come to pass!<br>

<br>Experiments have been done with basketball players, comparing improvement from those who actually practiced to those who only practiced in their imaginations and the results have been nearly identical!<br>

<br>This makes it crucial for us to monitor what goes into our subconscious mind.  If we allow ourselves to be focused on a lack of abundance, this will be realized in our lives.  If we watch too much nightly news and convince ourselves that the world is a terrible place full of selfish and hurtful people, this will be the reality we experience.<br>

<br>If we come to believe that God is a judge to be dreaded rather than a loving, caring father figure who protects us and wants the best for us, we will experience the consequences of that in our lives.  We will fear judgment and distance ourselves from our creator rather than looking to God for succor, comfort, and guidance.<br>

<br>Begin now to carefully, meticulously envision what you do want out of life.  Take time when you wake in the morning, or before you go to sleep at night, when you are driving in your car, or whenever you can spare a moment to imagine your life as you would have it.  Imagine it so thoroughly that it will be imprinted indelibly on your subconscious mind.  As faithful as anything in the universe, it will have no choice but to carry out your bidding.<br>

<br>Action steps:  <br>Prune negative thinking out of your life.  Begin to build a positive vision of your future.  Build a vision board.  Write down your goals.  Vividly imagine what it would be like to have already completed these goals.<br>

                <dt><a style="font-size:21px;" href="">Alien Abduction Insurance?</a></dt>
                <dd>We humans have a fundamental need for certainty.  We need to know that tomorrow we’ll be able to eat.  We want to be able to understand things, to ensure our safety, to predict the future and control the outcome of our lives.<br>

<br>In our modern day world, we seemed to have escalated our need for certainty.  Look at us!  We try to insure against every possible mishap!  There are insurance policies for homes, cars, life, health, and we’ve moved on to such things as terrorism insurance, travel insurance, pet insurance, crime insurance, and even such bizarre and comic policies as alien abduction insurance!<br>

<br>Do we think we can possibly avoid all pain by insuring ourselves against every possible catastrophe?<br>

<br>It’s ironic that in the search for absolute safety, consumers are working themselves to death to pay the premiums on their insurance bills.  Perhaps we need to add a category- insurance against too many insurance premiums.  I wonder what that would cost?<br>

<br>Why is insurance such a big business?  It is fear that drives many people to make the choices they do.  They constantly think about avoiding loss, instead of experiencing life. People, it seems are more concerned with what they might lose than with what they might accomplish.<br>

<br>You’ve all heard the saying, no risk, no reward, right?  Take a look at any successful person and you’ll find someone who stuck their neck out in a way that most don’t dare to do.  I challenge you to think of one successful person who hasn’t risked themselves significantly.<br>

<br>Now security may not sound like such a bad thing to you.  We all desire some reassurance that tomorrow won’t find us starving and on the streets.  But is security really good?  Let me illustrate with an example of what is probably the ultimate level of security: prison.  In jail, you are guaranteed a place to sleep, three square meals a day, and your time is your own.  But of freedom, you have none.  Prison offers the best security of any lifestyle you could possibly have.<br>

<br>Imagine if you will a mature bald eagle, launching from it’s perch atop a tall Frasier pine.  It is soaring over the valley below, seeking prey.<br>

<br>Our society would see this eagle and say: that’s dangerous.  It’s too high.  What if it falls?  And what if it can’t find enough food?  It’s not safe.<br>

<br>Now, imagine that same eagle in a wire cage at the zoo.<br>

<br>Our society would see this and say: That eagle is safe.  It can’t fly, but it can’t fall.  It’s guaranteed three meals a day and all the veterinary care it needs. That eagle has it made!<br>

<br>But does that eagle have it made?  When it can no longer do what it was designed by God to do, does it indeed have it made?<br>

<br>"If we don’t change, we don’t grow.
If we don’t grow, we are not really living.
Growth demands a temporary surrender of security."<br>
-Gail Sheehy<br>

<br>In our modern society, we’ve become stagnant.  We plan our lives around risk-free activities, and then at night, in the safety of our own homes, we attempt to fulfill our need for adventure by living vicariously through characters on television.   We like to read about and watch on the television characters that undergo struggles and conquer adversity, but we’d rather not experience any difficulties ourselves.  We’ve become so comfortable with our modern luxuries that we’ve forgotten how to strive.  Tony Campolo puts it this way: We tiptoe through life just so we can arrive safely at death!<br>

<br>Two hundred years ago, people set sail across the ocean to America because it offered the opportunity of freedom.  It offered no guarantees and no security, but people came because they knew freedom was more important than security.<br> 

<br>Since our forefathers founded this country, we’ve undergone a substantial shift.  We’ve gone from wanting to be free to wanting to be safe and secure.  This is evidenced in social security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and countless other government programs designed to provide a “safety net.” <br>

<br>But have you noticed yet what the relationship is between freedom and security?  They are polar opposites.  You can’t have freedom without giving up some measure of security.  And vice versa.  Are we running toward our dreams and goals or in our quest for safety have we resigned ourselves to running on a hamster wheel to pay for all that “safety?”  Are we still able to do what we were designed by God to do?<br>

<br>"An individual dies... when, instead of taking risks and hurling himself toward being, he cowers within, and takes refuge there."<br>  –E. M. Cioran<br>

<br>"The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise."<br>  –Tacitus<br>

<br>"Comfort is the enemy of achievement."<br>  –Farrah Gray<br>

<br>"...those who don’t have the courage to take risks and those who do experience the same amount of fear in life.  The only difference is that those who don’t take chances worry about trivial things.  If you’re going to have to overcome your fear and doubts anyway, you might as well make it count."<br>  – John Maxwell<br>

<br>Action Step: This week, risk yourself in a way you’ve never done before (I’m not advocating stupidly foolish risks; rather a life based on truly living, not on fear).<br>

<br>Alien Abduction Insurance (The Relationship of Freedom to Security)<br>

</dd>
                <dt><a style="font-size:21px;" href="">Freedom Through Self-Mastery</a></dt>
                <dd>I’d like to talk about a subject that is important to me and that subject is freedom.  As you know, I’d like to teach people how to become financially free, but I’d also like to help them live free lives in general.  We live in America, a beacon of freedom the world over, but how free are we?  I think many Americans have some misconceptions about what freedom is, and I’d like to address that today. I see them struggling to get free from a number of different issues:<br>


<br>Consumer Debt<br>
Materials Things<br>
Alcohol<br>
Cigarettes<br>
Drugs<br>
Pornography/sexual addictions<br>
Food<br>
T.V.<br>
Caffeine<br>
<br>Security (the idea that there should be no risk in life and that someone else should always be there to take care of us- be it our boss, the government, or the insurance companies).<br>

<br>The items on this list vary, and some of the items on this list are not intrinsically bad.  I think we can agree that it’s okay to have a glass of wine, for example, but the problem comes when we lose control of ourselves.  If I see a donut on the table, and as I’m walking by I tell myself, “I am not going to eat that donut,” and then a minute later notice it’s gone and I have sugary donut residue on my fingers, then I have a problem.  I’m not, in truth, free.  I’m actually a slave to my own impulse.  I’m not a slave to the donut- it’s just a piece of food sitting on the table.  But I am a slave to my own impulse.  I think this is where we face the greatest risk as a nation today.<br>

<br>Socrates said:<br>

"The truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery, while those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them."<br>

<br>Have you noticed that our government is getting bigger?  Have you stopped to wonder why?<br>

<br>As someone who has struggled to get free from a lot of the above-mentioned issues, I can tell you something I’ve learned along the way.<br>

<br>Habits are not changed by will-power alone, but by new ideas and new perspectives.<br>

<br>Let me give you an example:<br>

I started smoking at the age of 14 and quit shortly before I turned 20.  Why did I start smoking?  As an act of rebellion.  As an act of independence. I bought the advertisers imagery (you remember images of ruggedly independent cowboys smoking cigarettes).  Why did I quit?  It wasn’t health or finances that enticed me to quit.  What really galvanized me to quit was when I realized I was no longer a free man. I had become a slave to the tobacco companies.  Here I was sending them my money each week, making them wealthy, while killing myself slowly.  That’s not an act of independence!  That’s an act of self-destruction!<br>

<br>I’d like to ask you: how free are you?<br>

<br>Are you free from slavery to money?  Or does it dictate your actions nearly every waking hour?  Can you start your morning without the proper dosage of caffeine?  Are you free from the television?  Or are you addicted to the warped fiction of Hollywood and the gloom and doom of the nightly news?<br>

<br>Tony Robbins has a quote related to success I’d like to share with you: <br> 

“Success is doing what you want to do, when you want, where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want.”<br>

<br>Though I have a great respect for Tony and his teaching ability, I have to tell you that Tony is DEAD WRONG!  He couldn’t be farther from the truth.  <br>

<br>Success is not doing what you want, when you want.  That formula actually leads to to ruin and enslavement.  If you don’t know what I mean, I’ll illustrate:<br>

<br>Let’s take the realm of finance per se.  If you were to spend whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted, where would you end up?  You’d be bankrupt!  The same applies to every other area of your life.<br>

<br>Success is not doing what you want.<br> 

<br>Success is being able to do what’s right when the time comes.  Success is training yourself in self-discipline and self mastery.  That brings freedom.  So freedom is not something we inherit from our government or our country, or even our God.  Freedom is available to us, but we have to earn it.  If you want the freedom to live the ultimate life of wealth, health, peace, love, and happiness, there is only one way to achieve it.  Through self-mastery.<br>
</dd>
                <dt><a style="font-size:21px;" href="">Success is What? Discipline?</a></dt>
                <dd>If I were to advertise that I was going to give a speech on the subject of discipline, how many people would show up?<br>  

<br>How many of you would say, “Yeah!  I’ve been wanting to learn more about how I can discipline myself!”<br>

<br>Discipline is not a popular subject in our culture today.<br>

<br>But let me ask you some questions:<br>

<br>Do you want to be healthy?  Live a long life?<br>

<br>Would you like to be wealthy?  Or at the very least comfortable, having enough money?<br>

<br>Would you like to have good relationships in your life?<br>

<br>Then you NEED discipline.<br>

<br>Let’s start with health.  We all know how to exercise.  We all know the difference between healthy food and junk food.  We simply lack the discipline to make the right choices when the time comes.<br>

<br>The foundation for any healthy diet is what?  Discipline.<br>  
<br>Let’s look at finances.<br>

<br>We all know HOW to become wealthy.  Budget, live on less than you make, save, and invest.  But we often lack the discipline to do the right thing.<br>

<br>If you watch what television is selling, it oftentimes isn’t a product.  What it is they’re selling is what we as consumers are demanding.  We want instant results with LITTE TO NO WORK!  But you and I both know that’s now how things work.<br>

<br>There’s a quote in the bible that says:<br>

<br>Hebrews 12:11<br>  "All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness."<br>

<br>This is one of my favorite verses.  Every time you decide not to eat the chocolate bar and reach for an apple, you might feel a sense of loss, but in reality you are training and gaining in strength.  Every time you decide to hold off on that purchase you didn’t need to make, you might feel a momentary pang of regret, but it will ultimately lead to a wealthier and more financially secure life!  Every time you reject sin, you might feel like you’re missing out on something fun, but you’re not.  In reality, when you reject sin, you’re embracing peace and joy, and love!  Wouldn’t you agree that love, joy, and peace are essential elements to a successful life?<br>

<br>How many of you would agree that love is the secret to having the best life possible?<br>

<br>I’m telling you that without discipline, you will not be able to love and be loved!  That’s how serious this is.<br>

<br>Matthew Kelly Teaches the following:<br>

"To love requires us to take ourselves in our hands and give ourselves away.  But we can’t give ourselves if we do not first possess ourselves.  Many people are making promises they can’t keep in relationships today.  They are promising to give themselves in ways they are not able to do because they do not possess themselves.  They have no self-mastery, no discipline, and therefore are not free.  In order to love, we have to be free.  You will be able to love and be loved to the extent that you wrench yourself away from your temper, your appetites, and your impulses.  This is why we see such a huge lack of good relationships in our culture.  For someone who is addicted to instant gratification, a lasting relationship is an impossible dream."<br>

<br>I think it’s noteworthy to notice the way God set this system up.  The only way to say “YES” to the best life has to offer is to be able to say “NO” to yourself.   In every area of your life, you need discipline.<br>

<br>If you want to see improvement in your life, try increasing your level of self-discipline.  There is an inextricable link between success and self-discipline. <br> 

<br>Action Step:  Begin improving your levels of self-discipline today even if in small ways.  Through diet, exercise, and relationship, begin to practice self-discipline.  Learn to say no to yourself.<br>
